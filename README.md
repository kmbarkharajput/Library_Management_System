​Intuitive GUI: Easy-to-navigate windows and forms for seamless operation.

​Book Management: Functionality to Add, View, Update, and Delete book records.

​Member Tracking: System to manage library members, including contact details and history.

​Lending & Returns: Dedicated transaction module to log book issuance and acceptance of returns.

​Data Persistence: Uses a lightweight SQLite3 database to ensure data is saved between sessions.
